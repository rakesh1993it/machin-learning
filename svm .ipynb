    "In supervised learning, we start with importing dataset containing training attributes and the target attributes. \n",
    "The Supervised Learning algorithm will learn the relation between training examples and their associated target \n",
    "variables and apply that learned relationship to classify entirely new inputs (without targets).\n",
    "\n",
    "The ultimate goal of the Supervised learning algorithm is to predict Y with the maximum accuracy for a given new input X. There are several ways to implement Supervised Learning; we’ll explore some of the most commonly used approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the given datasets the machine learning problem is categorised into two types, Classification, and Regression. If the given data has both input (training) values and output (target) values, then it is a Classification problem. If the dataset has continuous numerical values of attributes without any target labels, then it comes under Regression problem.\n",
